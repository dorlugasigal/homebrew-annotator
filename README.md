# Annotator for Homebrew

This is the Homebrew tap for [Annotator](https://getannotator.app/),
a free Mac app for drawing on your screen as you explain: circles, arrows,
highlights, spotlight, zoom and blur over any app.

## Install

```sh
brew install --cask dorlugasigal/annotator/annotator
```

Homebrew adds this tap the first time you run it. Annotator needs macOS 14 or
later and an Apple M-series chip. It runs from the menu bar, not the Dock.

## Update

Save your boards and quit Annotator, then run:

```sh
brew update
brew upgrade --cask dorlugasigal/annotator/annotator
```

## Uninstall

```sh
brew uninstall --cask dorlugasigal/annotator/annotator
```

Your boards and settings stay on your Mac.
